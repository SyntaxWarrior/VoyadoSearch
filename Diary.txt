Decided to go with .Net Core 5 as I am curious to what could be new in the latest version
Also went with Angular as Im quite familiar with it and it should allow me to progress rather quickly.
Going to be using a code structure similar to a few projects Ive built recently with DI. 

Basically keep Domain in its own project, with Abstract classes in a supporting project and a Configuration project binding it together. 
The same structure will be used for Persistance (database), and any integrations. This way any one component can easily be switched out for another at a later stage without much issue.
This also helps keep the project easy to follow as dependencies are very contained within their area and dont leek into other parts.

I would have liked to have Angular in its own project and build pipeline as a separate front end project, but as the guidelines specifically state one solution I'll build angular inside .net core. It can always be separated later on.

In general Im building this project for it to be able to grow to something very large. For this specific case most of what I have done is overkill.

Setting up project structure. Im going for DI for the domain to keep it away from the web app. Also having public contracts in a separate project in case there could be other consumers for the data besides the web api.

Started thinking about how Im going to set up the search itself. I would like to make the Application/web layer as agnostic to it as possible.
Ill probably also need some kind of database for caching as most services seem to have a low limit on how many queries you can make per day without paying. Maybe Ill get a chance to try out SQLLite, been wanting to do that.

Backend strukturen är klar. Kör på strutkur för stort projekt (eftersom ni sa det skulle vara så). 
Även fått klart bing integrationen.
